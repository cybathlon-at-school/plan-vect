### How-To Laser Cut
The pdf_jammer command line tool informs you about the location of the created pdf's. This is how you laser-cut them.
1) Get the files on the Laser-Cutter PC
2) Open the PDF in Corel Draw (not Inkscape!)
3) Select all (Ctrl+A) and set the line width to "Hairline" at the center top in the tool bar
4) One sid-effect is that this creates black boundary boxes around the individual gripper drawings which would yield 
   slow engraving. The get rid of the black lines do:
   - Select All (*Ctr+A*) & Ungroup (possibly several times)
   - Unselect and while pressing *Alt*, select the boxes only by dragging in-between the gripper drawings horizontally
   - With two or three strokes you should be able to select all boundaries and delete them with *Delete*
5) *Ctrl+P* for printing. Select 5mm Wood.
6) Sent the print job which you can then position on the plate appropriately.
7) Do not forget vector ordering.
