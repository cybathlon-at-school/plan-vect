6) Install **pdfjam** (contained in texlive-extra-utils) - takes a few minutes

## How to use (for development)
### Python scripts
Before using those make sure you have the pipenv shell activated, i.e.  
```
cd <path/to/planvec/>
pipenv shell
```
#### main.py
```python main.py```   
This will run the main GUI to convert drawings to pdfs via vision.

#### scripts
There are couple of convenience scripts in ```planvec/scripts``` folder. For example the ```single_shot_planvec.py``` to run planvec on a single shot image taken with the camera without any GUI.

#### color_filter_app.py
```python color_filter_app.py```  
A utility tool to filter out color (ranges) from the webcam input. Can be used to determine the 
HSV values for color filters when doing image processing. Note to set the camera index in the script correctly.

### How-To Laser Cut
The pdf_jammer command line tool informs you about the location of the created pdf's. This is how you laser-cut them.
1) Get the files on the Laser-Cutter PC
2) Open the PDF in Corel Draw (not Inkscape!)
3) Select all (Ctrl+A) and set the line width to "Hairline" at the center top in the tool bar
4) One sid-effect is that this creates black boundary boxes around the individual gripper drawings which would yield 
   slow engraving. The get rid of the black lines do:
   - Select All (*Ctr+A*) & Ungroup (possibly several times)
   - Unselect and while pressing *Alt*, select the boxes only by dragging in-between the gripper drawings horizontally
   - With two or three strokes you should be able to select all boundaries and delete them with *Delete*
5) *Ctrl+P* for printing. Select 5mm Wood.
6) Sent the print job which you can then position on the plate appropriately.
7) Do not forget vector ordering.
